<mylo xyloto>
hurts like heaven
paradise
charlie brown
us against the world
M.M.I.X
every teardrop is a waterfall
major minus
U.F.O
Princess of china
up in flames
a hopeful transmission
dont let it break your eart
up witht eh birds
<xy>
square one
what if
white shadows
fix you
talk
x&y
speed of sound
a message
low
the hardest part
swallowed in the sea
twsiter logic
`til kingdom come


<>
politik
in my place
god put a smile uopn your face
the scientist
clocks
daylight
green eyes
warning sign
a whisper
a rush of blood to the head
amsterdam
<>

dont panic
shiver
spies
sparks
yellow
trouble
parachutes
high speed
we never change
everyhing's not lost
life is for living
